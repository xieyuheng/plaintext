Why .txt when we could have .draft or .rev1, .rev2 etc?

As strange as it might sound, I have been thinking of straying from .txt files.

I say this because, since I started using Linux neither Nano or Gedit (my two main editors) give me a default .txt extension when I save my file.

Why?

Probably because those applications are used by developers also, and the idea is, you can use them for writing code too. I know I could just delete any default extension Notepad gave me but it got me thinking.

This could also be exploited for my organisational methods.

I could save a file with any word as the extension.

Why not .list? Or .draft? Or even .keep?

So I experimented with the following files,

shopping.list
story1.draft
story1.rev1
story1.rev2
story2.draft
birthdays.keep

I opened each of them in turn and they opened, wrote and saved without issue in my default text file editing application, Gedit and Nano in shell.

I tend to open files from the Linux shell using 'ls' and the 'grep' command so this would help as an additional filtering method.

For example ....... ls d/*.keep

This would be very useful for version tracking too. To track the development of 'story1' for example I might,

                    ls d/story1*

This definitely has merits and I look forward to finding ways to exploit it.

Thanks for reading.
