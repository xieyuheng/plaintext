<pre>That million dollar business idea you had [and promptly forgot]

Everything around us is there because someone, at some point in history has stopped for a moment and thought, &apos;wouldn&apos;t this be easier of we just did this...&apos; and then probably went on to buy his or her very own private jet or yacht a year or so later.

I have never made a single penny from any of the business ideas in my businessideas.txt file but that&apos;s not to say I won&apos;t ever. Who knows, one day I might be writing this blog from the comfort of a sun lounger on a sun drenched beach, drinking cocktails and slurring through my typos.

But for now, this file is for those seemingly obvious solutions to problems you encounter everyday and wonder why no one has come up with a better way to overcome.

Before the idea has a chance to evaporate from my mind, I quickly pull this file up [from my drop-box folder] and secure it in the annals of history as my idea. If it still holds some appeal a few days later when I review it, I might submit for patent. That hasn&apos;t happened so far.

Nb: Before anyone has the idea, it would be pointless trying to hack my dropbox for this file unless you&apos;re interested in developing ideas for the likes of self-spinning bow-ties or khazoo based sheep gathering devices.
