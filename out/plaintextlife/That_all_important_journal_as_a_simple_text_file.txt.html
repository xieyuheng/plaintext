<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">That all important journal as a simple text file

For the longest time, I avoided keeping a journal as there was never a medium I could trust to still be there in ten years time, when, let&apos;s face it, you want to be able to enjoy ten years worth of what made you... you. &quot;Paper journals&quot;, I hear you cry. Sure. But they&apos;re open to anyone to read and I kind of feel more comfortable expressing my half-baked thoughts into a private corner to stew a while before revealing them fully cooked and ready for consumption to the world - if they ever make it that far.

So this is how I set out my plain text file journal, which I keep along with my other confidential files in my personal folder, on my hard drive.

My journal is one of the few files I have in the &apos;j&apos; area of the folder so it is easy to find. All I have to do is open the folder and hit &apos;j&apos;.

Now, down to the writing. You may think having to type in the date, each and every day as &apos;too much work&apos; given the amount of apps which create dates for you. Believe me, it takes a second or two and in the grand scheme of things, it&apos;s a second or two well spent.

I go strictly in ascending order. The first entry I ever wrote is at the top of the page. My most recent entry is at the end. To make a new entry, I simply hit Ctrl+End. Because I am working with a plain text file, I am there in lightning speed, ready to hammer out today&apos;s ramblings.

I use the same system for time stamping as I use in my calendar.txt file. I will point out, my journal.txt file and calendar.txt file are two separate files. My journal is where I record how the day went, retrospectively, what I thought about it, lessons learned and things to try in future [maybe generating new files]
My calendar.txt file is for planning. Every date for the rest of the year is already written out, separated from the day before and the day after by a nice, friendly empty space to cursor into.

The file goes something like...

Feb 15 Mo
=========
0615 Up.
0700 Family up.
0900 Left for shops. xxx bought this and yyy bought that. Man in jewellers eager for sale - remember Kevin said he would sort a discount on that necklace if we came back and asked for him.
1200 Lunch. Chicken wraps. Leave bell pepper out next time.
...
and so on.

I underline each date and always keep the same date format. I like to write times without colons ie. 0715 instead of 07:15. The reason for this is if I am making an entry on my phone or tablet, I have to shift to another keyboard and I lose the flow of writing. I also occasionally lapse into &apos;txt spk&apos; if I am using my phone and do not have a great deal of time. It&apos;s no biggie. I can always open the file later and correct it.

As it is, it will always be evolving but I like it as it is and it helps maintain my discipline of writing a little every day.
