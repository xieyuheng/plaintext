<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">12 big advantages of plain text files

1. Using only plain text documents forces a discipline to think in terms of text. For example, you might struggle to find an app and sketch the size of your floor for a carpet fitting but what could be simpler than a small text file with...

w: 2.45m [window to wall]
d: 3.21m [door to fireplace]

2. Plain text files are easy to open on different platforms. Windows 7 will open a .txt file just as easily as an XP machine, phone, tablet or a mac for that matter.

3. Plain text files are small in terms of memory size.

4. Having a habit of using text files eliminates the need to decide which format is best. This may sound trivial but you would be surprised how distracting it is to choose whether list is better as a spreadsheet, document or whatever else you might have.

5. Plain text is easy for windows to search through.

6. Your plain text app is usually one of windows default menu programs available through right-click.

7. Plain text files are viewable lightning fast in windows &apos;preview&apos; pane in explorer, making it quick to scroll through files and not having to open them.

8. Because they are so easy to work with, they can all be stored in the same folder.

9. In windows, if the files are categorised by type as the first word in the filename, simply typing a letter will take you to that letter in the list. eg, if you have 500 files and you want your &apos;notes&apos; section, type &apos;n&apos; and the folder will jump to that letter in the list. This happens with most office files in windows but just sit back and time it when you&apos;ve a preview pane open and your version of windows with Office 2010 is trying to convert a Word 2003 document for preview... takes forever!

10. My favourite! When you copy and paste that killer article you need to keep, from a web page, Notepad (if that is your weapon of choice) doesn&apos;t throw a wobbler when you paste the contents of the clipboard.
Try that with word or excel and you get all kinds of stuff you didn&apos;t even realise were there, images, spacing etc.
Not notepad, keep the text, format it loosely as it was and bin the multimedia!

11. Anything in a plain text format has a zero distraction promise built right in!
As the internet matures, it is finding ways to pay it&apos;s way.
This usually means any page you access is littered with ads for this and that. Trying to concentrate on what you came to view can sometimes be a real effort.
Plain text has no such distractions. Unless you&apos;re easily distracted by black type on a white background :)

12. Because they are so small, if you&apos;re taking notes from another window you can hover a notepad window beside the contents of whatever you are taking notes from. For example, if you&apos;re researching the the history of the wellington boot, you might have the wikipedia page open and a narrow notepad window open on top or even beside it, if you wish to resize your windows. My laptop screen is normal height but quite wide so I can have a few windows side by side.
