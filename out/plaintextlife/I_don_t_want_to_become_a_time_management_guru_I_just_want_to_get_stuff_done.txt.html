<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don&apos;t want to become a time management guru. I just want to get stuff done!

I hear this from all the people I work with and the same underlying frustration runs through all their complaints.

There seems to be two things that motivate most &apos;ordinary&apos; people while at work, turning their eight or nine hours of paid work into something they can justify as a career. Forget your high flyers and ruthless goal seekers for a moment. We&apos;re talking ordinary people who want to do a good job and feel a bit of pride in what they do as they drive home from their toil. In general, they want to;

1. ] Leave the office/factory/workplace, bang on their finish time.
2. ] Leave feeling they have achieved something.

I know this because I am one of those people. I enjoy my work for the most part but I also enjoy what I work for - my family and a sense of pride in what I do.

Guess what?
Would it surprise you to learn, I also have a plain text file for these?

I have a file, only a few lines long where I state what it important to me and why I work. It is personal so I won&apos;t share it here but as a family guy, you can probably guess what is written in those few lines.

The other part; about leaving work at the time beyond which I no longer get paid?
A cleverly laid out file which specifies my rights as a European worker?
Lack of willingness?
No commitment?
None of the above.
I just like spending time with the coolest people I know.
My family.
