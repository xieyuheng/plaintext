I keep all my text files in two folders which look pretty much the same.

Two folders because I like to keep my private stuff just that - private. I have no doubt my dropbox account is secure but as long as it is online, it is never as secure as the folder on my own hard drive (which I back up - of course)

All the rest of my plain text files live in my dropbox account. If you don&apos;t already have one, I would recommend one. It&apos;s the easiest way to sync the files on my laptop to the files on my phone and tablet.
I have a simple way to view the folder structure also.

I separate all my files with headers. Empty text files which serve no other purpose than to make it easier to view my folder contents and find them more quickly.

It looks something like...

0 ___________________.txt
1 ___________________.txt
1 todo.txt
1 calender.txt
2 ___________________.txt
3 ___________________.txt
...
a ___________________.txt
b ___________________.txt


---

The frequently used or updated files start with 1 - keeps them at the top of the list, close at hand. Work in progress, any file I have started but not yet completed always starts with zero so it smacks me in the face when I open this folder.
When it comes to file naming, I try to think of the first word I will think of when I want to try and retrieve that file. Instead of &apos;family-birthdays.txt&apos; I use &apos;birthdays.txt&apos; and just include everyone.

Lastly, moving on to files themselves for a moment, I always end a plain text file with three dashes. Because you cannot cursor to something which isn&apos;t there, it lets me know where I can quickly include a new comment or line.
