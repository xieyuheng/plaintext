<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">the benefits of plain text

I have been a hardcore &apos;plain texter&apos; for over a year now and the habit does not seem to be fading.

The main benefit is my increased focus on the task in front of me.

I have been exploring Linux and the use of command line a lot and am reaping the benefits of that also.

In particular, the use of file searching for specific words. This is something it might never have occured to me to even think about had I not made the switch to plaintext files.

A few of the rules I have added to my way of working at my laptop,

1. I never use spaces in filenames. Always use _ [underscore]

2. I never capitalise unnecessarily. Linux does not like it. It can accomodate but it adds work and there is no point in that.

3. This is an important one. Before saving a snippet of code or other text, url, address, phone number etc I try to get it down to one line. Rather than creating a small file such as &apos;addresses.txt&apos;, I distill the name and address of the person or company into one line seperated by comma&apos;s to make it readable. These one line entries all go into one file. I now keep a single file of every important line of data I need. This makes searching within Linux command line an absolute doddle and returns the results in a flash. I also use hashtags liberally at the end of each snippet to make searching even simpler. This makes that one file very unordered but it has no need to be ordered when all I do is search and return what I need.

For example a few lines may be,

john smith, phone 0123-456-789, 123 ashford avenue, london #friends #vintagecars
www.google.co.uk #url #search
tumblelane cottage, fareham road, kent 01222-777-333 #break #holiday #cottage
gavin jones, roofer, 111-444-555, #recommend #tradesman

This is just an example of the kind of thing I add to my text file.

4. Always add a title and keywords to the document, no matter how trivial the document is. This helps enomously in searches and has made my pace of work so much faster.
For example, a file for making my favourite curry recipe, &apos;recipe_dhanzak.txt&apos; might look like,

title ......  dhanzak curry
keywords ... recipe curry pressurecooker kitchen
ingredients,
lentils [2 cups]
etc...

Then when I search for &apos;curry&apos; or &apos;recipe&apos; using command line, I get,

user@linuxmc
d/recipe_dhanzak.txt : keywords ... recipe curry pressurecooker kitchen

I know to open that file [and print off should I need to]

4. Learning how to use the &apos;grep&apos; function in Linux. This works in combination with the fact I store every single written document in a specific folder in the my home directory. This folder is 99.9% plain text files.
For those who do not know, using &apos;grep&apos; in Linux is like having access to every word in every file in an instant.
Say my folder &apos;/d&apos; has 3000 files in it and each file averages 300 characters, and I wish to search for the phrase &apos;recipe&apos; all I do, in command line,

grep &apos;recipe&apos; d/*

... and in a flash, command line will return a list of every line of every instance of that phrase. Not the whole file, just the line where it occurs and the name of the file it occurs in.

So that is about it for this post.

I hope this will encourage a few readers out there. My methods suit me and I like to think they might suit others too.
