system connectivity vs simplicity?

Now that my plain text file system is firmly established as my way of keeping the chaos of everyday life at bay and ensuring what needs to get done, gets done, I was reflecting on whether the success of the system is due to the simplicity and ease of the plain text format or the fact I use dropbox to keep it all hooked together across my different devices.

About a year and a half ago, I had a different phone which was based on the same operating system as my laptop. They were both Microsoft and I could sync spreadsheets through the cloud. It seemed simple enough and I thought spreadsheets were simple enough to keep updated, but guess what, it didn't stick. It didn't become second nature, to plan, record notes or even check my to-do list on my phone or laptop.
I don't think it would have been any better if I'd used dropbox for those spreadsheets either as it was fiddly opening them all the time and they took relatively 'ages' to open as I remember.

That only leaves the simplicity of the file system as the reason I took to it so well. The fact I can record anything in any way, quickly and without the need for columns and rows is very liberating.

I do still keep one spreadsheet though. I use it for tracking our finances which is what spreadsheets are good at, adding and subtracting quickly. I keep this as a local file though, on my laptop.
I still use desktop publishing too, but only to copy and paste my plain text files into when I need a professional look to a letter or something else.

In conclusion, connectivity is important but not as important as simplicity, in my opinion.
