<pre>Choice of font

Choice of font is very important.

I use a monospaced font wherever possible.

Why?
Simply for spacing.

In the absence of more advanced features in your simple notepad, you occasionally might need to create spaces and have them stay a standard, uniform size.

Imagine a simple table.

## name age
-----------
01 mark 31
02 john 32
03 mary 51
04 fred 41
05

etc...

The above is not possible with non-monospaced fonts. The file will open and compress the thinner letters against the others, the letter &apos;i&apos; will compress well and all your spacing will disappear.

Also, for times when you like to underline things with a row of ==== or ---- you simply need to type as many characters are in the title.

eg.

title 12
========

subtitle 3.2
------------

annotation 4
************

You get the idea.
In summary, you will save yourself a lot of time if you use a monospaced font - all the cool kids are doing it!
