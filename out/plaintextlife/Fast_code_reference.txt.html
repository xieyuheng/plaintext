Designing and programming websites and applications is a hobby I have enjoyed for a while now. Web sites and Microsoft Access databases are a particular favourite of mine, mainly because they&apos;re relatively easy to learn and rely mainly on code for their function.

I have also enjoyed some small commercial successes from this hobby in the past.

The main problem I used to have before my move over to documenting my life and work in plain text, was how to remember code from previous successes.
Let me explain. A function within a site or database is written in code, whether it is PHP, Visual Basic or MySql, a snippet of code will make something happen. Get that code wrong and the whole thing might crash. But the worst is when you&apos;re on a new project and you&apos;re trying to do something, make something happen, you know you&apos;ve done before, but you just cant remember the code you used. For some code just having a comma in the wrong place or not there at all can cause an hour of debugging and that, as you might imagine is not so fun.

Once again, plain text files have transformed how I recall old snippets of code and has massively cut the amount of time I spend debugging my code.

PHP isn&apos;t so bad, as it is written as plain text in the first place but MS Access is written into the Access&apos; software and isn&apos;t easy to search. You have to open each database, if you can remember which function in which application did what what you&apos;re trying to achieve and search each individual form or report. There are upwards of fifty projects on my hard drive and each projects might have another twenty to sixty objects in them... I&apos;ll let you work that one out.

For all the code-intensive Access applications, I went through each one and bulk copied the VB behind all my forms and reports etc into individual text files for my common folder, naming them according to which application they came from.

Now, searching for code is as easy as remembering part of the code and typing it into the search field in explorer. For example, if I know I want to run a few lines of SQL code for an Access database, I type &apos;docmd.runsql&apos; into the search field. I keep a preview pane open so I can quickly browse the files in the resulting search and no longer have any issue finding what I need. Of course, when I find what I need, I can open the text file and copy and paste it into whatever project I am working on.

Job done!
