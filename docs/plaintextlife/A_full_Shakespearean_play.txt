A full Shakespearean play!

In keeping with my article on having full length articles at hand as text files, I thought it might be fun to see how 'heavy' a full Shakespearean play might be on my Drop Box folder.

I visited the chaps at shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html and copied and pasted the content into a text file for my own reference [we did this play at high school]

Have a guess how much space it took?

1Mb?

2.5Mb?

Neither.

A teeny, tiny 101 Kilobytes. Less than most images you load in pages in your browser!

That is how small data can be when we leave out all the bells, whistles and just store the real content.
