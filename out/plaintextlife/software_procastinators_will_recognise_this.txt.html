For those of us prone to putting things off there is a variety of software just begging to offer you it&apos;s own unique way of distracting you from what you actually want to achieve.

Excel allows you to change cell colours until your heart is content. You can even create a rule where the colour changes according to the cells contents and any criteria the content meets!

Access is amazing for gobbling up hours or even days while you tweak the visual basic behind the forms to make it work &apos;just right&apos;.

Word is a formatting freak&apos;s dream come true. Fonts, letter spacing and borders are all only a click away.

None of this helps to get the content into the report or plan you need to bash out.

What is needed is a way to get that content out of your brain [or collective brains] and into a record of some sort.

What is needed is distraction free software.

Notepad [for Windows users] or Gedit [for Linux or OS users] is ideal in this scenario.

A plain text file hooked up to a projector at the front is, in my opinion, more efficient than a white board at the front of the room. Can a white board allow you to copy and paste it&apos;s content directly into a mail so each member of the meeting has their own copy of the notes?

Get the content on the screen, save, close. Move on.

Any pertinent points are there in raw form should anyone wish to format in another way later on for a top level report or for web site publication for example.
