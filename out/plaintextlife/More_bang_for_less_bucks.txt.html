<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">More bang for less bucks

I have tried a good handful of applications on my laptop, phone and tablet to kick start me into getting organised.

Very few stuck with me.

The best ones all had reminders and calenders built in, could take pictures and promised [but never delivered] to be able to share with everything else in my little sphere of existence.
Then, one night, I had been sat for ten minutes debating the best format and method for working through a problem I had.

It was a multi-level problem so I could have used a database application.
Others had to use the solution and they were all way more comfortable with spreadsheets.
The managers wanted something they could open quickly, cut and paste seamlessly and be able to edit if they needed [that&apos;s managers for you]

After fifteen minutes, my night seemed doomed if I couldn&apos;t make that one decision.

So I opened Notepad and began to type.

Nothing more complex than the steps I needed to go through to complete the work.

And then it struck me. Why not just use a simple text file to work through the issue, get the underlying data just right and then simply email cut&apos;n&apos;pasted copy to those concerned.

It worked a treat.

In fact, I drove home that night, wondering if I could make all my problems as simple as this just by cutting out overly-complicated software.

And that is what I have been doing for the past few weeks. Whenever I get a new issue, I work through it in Notepad, save it to drop box and add or edit as and when.

All those to-do lists, one sentence notes, song lyrics that catch me off guard - I save them all as plain text files. They take up to no memory space and open on anything.

So that&apos;s my story.

What&apos;s yours?
