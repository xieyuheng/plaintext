<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My neat &amp; compact personal library

Remembering back to the early days of home computing, before the internet was available, I remember using an encyclopedia called Encarta which came on a CD Rom. [Encarta, if you don&apos;t know was like a mini version of Wikipedia before Wikipedia even had an internet to exist on.]

It felt awesome, mind blowing really, to be able to search for and read articles with pictures from a seemingly endless trove of articles; all on a single 650 Mb CD!

We take it for granted now, if we&apos;re looking for something, we can type our search phrase into a search engine and somebody, somewhere, sometime will have posted something about it.

So where does this link in with my use of plain text files, I hear you ask.

Browsing can be great but what about that article or piece you don&apos;t want to lose or just liked so much, you want to keep it at hand. That is where the plain text file angle comes in.

I keep small files on anything that takes my fancy from home improvement to lean methodology. If I read something I like, it is a simple matter of selecting it all, copying and pasting into Notepad so I can access later it on my laptop, tablet or phone.

When I am stuck in a queue, or just generally waiting for something, I scroll down to my articles section and delve in.

Neat, compact and very easy to sustain.
